        A French philosopher said, “No man is strong unless he bears within his
        character antitheses strongly marked.” The strong man holds in a living
        lend strongly marked opposites. Not ordinarily do men achieve this
        balance of opposites. Not ordinarily do men achieve this balance of
        opposites. The idealists are not usually realistic, and the realists are
        not usually idealistic. The militant are not generally known to be
        passive, nor the passive to be militant. Seldom are the humble
        self-assertive, or the self-assertive humble. But life at its best is a
        creative synthesis of opposites in fruitful harmony. The philosopher
        Hegel said that truth is found neither in the thesis or the antithesis,
        but in an emergent synthesis that reconciles the two.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus recognized the need for blending opposites. He knew that his
        disciples would face a difficult and hostile world, where they would
        confront the recalcitrance of political officials and the intransigence
        of the protectors of the old order. He knew that they would meet cold
        and arrogant men whos hearts had been hardened by the long winter of
        traditionalism. So he said to them, “Behold, I send you forth as sheep
        in the midst of wolves.” And he gave them a formula for action, “Be ye
        therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.” It is pretty
        difficult to imagine a single person having, simultaneously, the
        characteristics of the serpent and the dove, but this is what Jesus
        expects. We must combine the toughness of the serpent and the softness
        of the dove, a tough mind and a tender heart.

        Let us consider, first, the need for a tough mind, characterized by
        incisive thinking, realistic appraisal, and decisive judgment. The tough
        mind is sharp and penetrating, breaking through the crust of legends and
        myths and sifting the true from the false. The tough-minded individual
        is astute and discerning. He
      </p>

      <p>
        Who doubts that this toughness of mind is one of man’s greatest needs?
        Rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard, solid thinking?
        Rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard, solid thinking.
        There is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked
        solutions. Nothing pains some people more than having to think.
      </p>
      <p>
        This prevalent tendency toward soft mindedness is found in man’s
        unbelievable gullibility. Take our attitude toward advertisement. We are
        so easily led to purchase a product because a television or radio
        advertisement pronounces it better than any other. Advertisers have long
        since learned that most people are soft minded, and they capitalize on
        this susceptibility with skillful and effective slogans.
      </p>
      <p>
        This undue gullibility is also seen in the tendency of many readers to
        accept the printed word of the press as final truth. Few people realize
        that even our authentic channels of information - the press, the
        platform, and in many instances the pulpit - do not give us objective
        and unbiased truth. Few people have the toughness of mind to judge
        critically and to discern the true from the false, the fact from the
        fiction. Our minds are constantly being invaded by legions of
        half-truths, prejudices, and false facts. One of the great needs of
        mankind is to be lifted above the morass of false propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soft-minded individuals are prone to embrace all kinds of superstitions.
        Their minds are constantly invaded by irrational fears, which range from
        fear of Friday the thirteenth to fear of a black cat crossing one’s
        path. As the elevator made its upward climb in one of the large hotels
        of New York City, I noticed for the first time that there was no
        thirteenth floor - floor fourteen followed floor twelve. On inquiring
        from the elevator operator the reason for this omission, he said, “This
        practice is followed by most large hotels because of the fear of
        numerous people to stay on a thirteenth floor.” Then he added, “The real
        foolishness of the fear is to be found in the fact that the fourteenth
        floor is actually the thirteenth.” Such fears leave the soft mind
        haggard by day and haunted by night.
      </p>
      <p>
        The soft-minded man always fears change. He feels security in the status
        quo, and he has an almost morbid fear of the new. For him, the greatest
        pain is the pain of a new idea. An elderly segregationist in the South
        is reported to have said, “I have come to see now that desegregation is
        inevitable. But I pray God that it will not take place until after I
        die.” The soft-minded person always wants to freeze the moment and hold
        life in the gripping yoke of sameness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soft mindedness often invades religion. This is why religion has
        sometimes rejected new truth with dogmatic passion. Through edicts and
        bulls, inquisitions and excommunications, the church has attempted to
        prorogue truth and place an impenetrable stone wall in the path of the
        truth-seeker. The historical philological criticism of the Bible is
        considered by the soft minded as blasphemous, and reason is often looked
        upon as the exercise of a corrupt faculty. Soft-minded persons have
        revised the Beatitudes to read, “Blessed are the pure in ignorance: for
        they shall see God.”

      </p>
      <p>
        We do not need to look far to detect the dangers of soft mindedness.
        Dictators, capitalizing on soft mindedness, have led men to acts of
        barbarity and terror that are unthinkable in civilized society. Adolf
        Hitler realized that soft mindedness was so prevalent among his
        followers that he said, “I use emotion for the many and reserve reason
        for the few.” In Mein Kampf he asserted: By means of shrewd lies,
        unremittingly repeated, itis possible to make people believe that heaven
        is hell - and hell, heaven…. The greater the lie, the more readily will
        it be believed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soft mindedness is one of the basic causes of race prejudice. The
        tough-minded person always examines the facts before he reaches
        conclusions; in short, he postjudges. The tender-minded person reaches a
        conclusion before he has examined the first fact; in short, he prejudges
        and is prejudiced. Race prejudice is based on groundless fears,
        suspicions, and misunderstandings. There are those who are sufficiently
        soft minded to believe in the superiority of the white race and the
        inferiority of the Negro race in spite of the tough-minded research of
        anthropologists who reveal the falsity of such a notion. There are
        soft-minded persons who argue that racial segregation should be
        perpetuated because Negroes lag behind in academic, health, and moral
        standards. They are not tough minded enough to realize that lagging
        standards are the result of segregation and discrimination. They do not
        recognize that it is rationally unsound and sociologically untenable to
        use the traffic effects of segregation as an argument for its
        continuation. Too many politicians in the South recognize this disease
        of soft mindedness that engulfs their constituency. With insidious zeal,
        they make inflammatory statements and disseminate distortions and
        half-truths that arouse abnormal fears and morbid antipathies within the
        minds of uneducated and underprivileged whites, leaving them so confused
        that they are led to acts of meanness and violence that no normal person
        commits.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is little hope for us until we become tough minded enough to break
        loose from the shackles of prejudice, half-truths, and downright
        ignorance. The shape of the world today does not permit us the luxury of
        soft mindedness. A nation or a civilization that continues to produce
        soft-minded men purchases its own spiritual death on an installment
        plan.
      </p>
      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>
        But we must not stop with the cultivation of a tough mind. The gospel
        also demands a tender heart. Tough mindedness without tenderheartedness
        is cold and detached, leaving one’s life in a perpetual winter devoid of
        the warmth of spring and the gentle heat of summer. What is more tragic
        than to see a person who has risen to the disciplined heights of tough
        mindedness but has at the same time sunk to the passionless depths of
        hardheartedness?
      </p>
      <p>
        The hardhearted person never truly loves. He engages in a crass
        utilitarianism that values other people mainly according to their
        usefulness to him. He never experiences the beauty of friendship,
        because he is too cold to feel affection for another and is too
        self-centered to share another’s joy and sorrow. He is an isolated
        island. No outpouring of love links him the mainland of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hardhearted person lacks the capacity for genuine compassion. He is
        unmoved by the pains and afflictions of his brothers. He passes
        unfortunate men every day, but he never really sees them. He gives
        dollars to a worthwhile charity, but he gives not of his spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hardhearted individual never sees people as people, but rather as
        mere objects or as impersonal cogs in an ever-turning wheel. In the vast
        wheel of industry, he sees men as hands. In the massive wheel of big
        city life, he sees men as digits in a multitude. In the deadly wheel of
        army life, he sees men as numbers in a regiment. He depersonalizes life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus frequently illustrated the characteristics of the hardhearted. The
        rich fool was condemned not because he was not tough minded, but rather
        because he was not tenderhearted. Life for him was a mirror in which he
        saw only himself, and not a window through which he saw other selves.
        Dives went to hell not because he was wealthy, but because he was not
        tenderhearted enough to see Lazarus and because he made no attempt to
        bridge the gulf between himself and his brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus reminds us that the good life combines the toughness of the
        serpent and the tenderness of the dove. To have serpentlike qualities
        devoid of dovelike qualities is to be passionless, mean, and selfish. To
        have dovelike without serpentlike qualities is to be sentimental,
        anemic, and aimless. We must combine strongly marked antitheses.
      </p>
      <p>
        We as Negroes must bring together tough mindedness and
        tenderheartedness, if we are to move creatively toward the goal of
        freedom and justice. Soft-minded individuals among us feel that the only
        way to deal with oppression is by adjusting to it. They acquiesce and
        resign themselves to segregation. They prefer to remain oppressed. When
        Moses led the children of Israel from the slavery of Egypt to the
        freedom of the Promised Land, he discovered that slaves do not always
        welcome their deliverers. They would rather bear those ills they have,
        as Shakespeare pointed out, than flee to others that they know not of.
        They prefer the “fleshpots of Egypt” to the ordeals of emancipation. But
        this not the way out. Soft-minded acquiescence is cowardly. My friends,
        we cannot win the respect of the white people of the South or elsewhere
        if we are willing to trade the future of our children for our personal
        safety and comfort. Moreover, we must learn that passively to accept an
        unjust system is to cooperate with that system, and thereby to become a
        participant in its evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        And there are hardhearted and bitter individuals among us who would
        combat the opponent with physical violence and corroding hatred.
        Violence brings only temporary victories; violence, by creating many
        more social problems than it solves, never brings permanent peace. I am
        convinced that if we succumb to the temptation to use violence in our
        struggle for freedom, unborn generations will be the recipients of a
        long and desolate night of bitterness, and our chief legacy to them will
        be a never-ending reign of chaos. A Voice, echoing through the corridors
        of time, says to every intemperate Peter, “Put up thy sword.” History is
        cluttered with the wreckage of nations that failed to follow Christ’s
        command.
      </p>
      <h2>III</h2>
      <p>
        A third way is open to our quest for freedom, namely nonviolent
        resistance, which combines tough mindedness and tenderheartedness and
        avoids the complacency and do-nothingness of the soft minded and the
        violence and bitterness of the hardhearted. My belief is that this
        method must guide our action in the present crisis in race relations.
        Through nonviolent resistance we shall be able to oppose the unjust
        system and at the same time love the perpetrators of the system. We must
        work passionately and unrelentingly for full stature as citizens, but
        may it never be said, my friends, that to gain it we used the inferior
        methods of falsehood, malice, hate, and violence.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would not conclude without applying the meaning of the text to the
        nature of God. The greatness of our God lies in the fact that he is both
        tough minded and tenderhearted. He has qualities both of austerity and
        of gentleness. The Bible, always clear in stressing both attributes of
        God, expresses his tough mindedness in his justice and wrath and his
        tenderheartedness in his love and grace. God has two outstretched arms.
        One is strong enough to surround us with justice, and one is gentle
        enough to embrace us with grace. On the one hand, God is a God of
        justice who punished Israel for her wayward deeds, and on the other
        hand, he is a forgiving father whose heart was filled with unutterable
        joy when the prodigal son returned home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am thankful that we worship a God who is both tough minded and
        tenderhearted. If God were only tough minded, he would be a cold,
        passionless despot sitting in some far-off heaven “contemplating all,”
        as Tennyson puts it in “The Palace of Art.” He would be Aristotle’s
        “unmoved mover,” self-knowing but not other-loving. But if God were only
        tenderhearted, he would be too soft and sentimental to function when
        things go wrong and incapable of controlling what he has made. He would
        be like H. G. Well’s loveable God in God, the Invisible King, who is
        strongly desirous of making a good world but finds himself helpless
        before the surging powers of evil. God is neither hardhearted nor soft
        minded. He is tough minded enough to transcend the world; he is
        tenderhearted enough to live in it. He does not leave us alone in our
        agonies and struggles. He seeks us in dark places and suffers with us
        and for us in our tragic prodigality.
      </p>
      <p>
        At times we need to know that the Lord is a God of justice. When
        slumbering giants of injustice emerge in the earth, we need to know that
        there is a God of power who can cut them down like the grass and leave
        them withering like the Greek herb. When our most tireless efforts fail
        to stop the surging sweep of oppression, we need to know that in this
        universe is a God whose matchless strength is a fit contrast to the
        sordid weakness of man. But there are also times when we need to know
        that God possesses love and mercy. When we are staggered by the chilly
        winds of adversity and battered by the raging storms of disappointment
        and when through our folly and sin we stray into some destructive far
        country and are frustrated because of a strange feeling of homesickness,
        we need to know that there is Someone who loves us, cares for us,
        understands us, and will give us another chance. When days grow dark and
        nights grow dreary, we can be thankful that our God combines in his
        nature creative synthesis of love and justice that will lead us through
        life’s dark valleys and into sunlit pathways of hope and fulfillment.
