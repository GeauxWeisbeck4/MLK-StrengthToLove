        <p>
          Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor,
          and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless
          them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them
          that despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be children
          of your Father which is in heaven.
          <br />
