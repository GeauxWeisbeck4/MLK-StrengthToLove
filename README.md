# BASIC STYLING AND CHAPTER 1 PUBLISHED
It is the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day and I haven't gotten near as far on this project as I wanted to before publishing it... nevertheless, time has run out on me and I am publishing where I am at so far! I have gotten some VERY VERY basic CSS styling and Bootstrap done on the website so far. Some very ugly styling - haha - but it will have to do so I can at least publish the first rendition of the homepage with the first chapter of text so you have something to read on MLK Day 2022!

I welcome other contributors who want to assist in getting this project up and going, as well as welcoming any contributions to this project! I aim to promote the words of MLK Jr. and democracy during these times. Thanks for reading and checking out my project and I hope you follow up as I continue to add more chapters and style this site to look beautiful, just like Dr. King's words!

# UPDATED STYLING AND CHAPTER 2 PUBLISHED
I added new CSS styling, new images, a new quote from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the text for Chapter 2 from Strength to Love (actually done on MLK Day). More updates to come in the future. Next: Donation section on the front page.
