# MLK-StrengthToLove

A tribute to the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with a full publishing of his Strength to Love Text. I started this project on January 16, 2022 and am returning on January 6, 2023 to complete it. I should have done this a long time ago, but many things have happened since then. I am excited to be back and working on such an inspiring and awesome project!

## Project Goals

- To share the amazing book "Strength to Love" by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. I believe it is his finest work. It speaks about democracy, truth, love and many other things our society could really use as important words of wisdom. 
- To blog about my own interpretations and feelings about his book.
- Spread awareness about these issues so they may be discussed more openly to help our sick society heal some of its wounds.
- Showcase the imporovement in my skill as a developer.

## I Hope you enjoy it!
