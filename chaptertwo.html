        <h3>
          Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing
          of your mind.
          <br />
          -Romans 12:2
        </h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          “Do not conform” is difficult advice in a generation when crowd
          pressures have unconsciously conditioned our minds and feet to move to
          the rhythmic drumbeat of the status quo. Many voices and forces urge
          us to choose the path of least resistance, and bid us never to fight
          for an unpopular cause and never to be found in a pathetic minority of
          two or three.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even certain of our intellectual disciplines persuade us of the need
          to conform. Some philosophical sociologists suggest that morality is
          merely group consensus and that the folkways are the right ways. Some
          psychologists say that mental and emotional adjustment is the reward
          of thinking and acting like other people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Success, recognition, and conformity are the bywords of the modern
          world where everyone seems to crave the anesthetizing security of
          being identified with the majority.
        </p>
        <h2>I</h2>
        <p>
          In spite of this prevailing tendency to conform, we as Christians have
          a mandate to be nonconformists. The Apostle Paul, who knew the inner
          realities of the Christian faith, counseled, “Be not conformed to this
          world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.” We are
          called to be people of conviction, not conformity; of moral nobility,
          not social respectability. We are commanded to live differently and
          according to a higher loyalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every true Christian is a citizen of two worlds, the world of time and
          the world of eternity. We are, paradoxically, in the world and yet not
          of the world. To the Philippian Christians, Paul wrote, “We are a
          colony of heaven.” They understood what he meant, for their city of
          Philippi was a Roman colony. When Rome wished to Romanize a province,
          she established a small colony of people who lived by Roman law and
          Roman customs and who, though in another country, held fast to their
          Roman allegiance. This powerful, creative minority spread the gospel
          of Roman culture. Although the analogy is imperfect - the Roman
          settlers lived within a framework of injustice and exploitation, that
          is, colonialism - the Apostle does point to the responsibility of
          Christians to imbue an unchristian world with the ideals of a higher
          and more noble order. Living in the colony of time, we are ultimately
          responsible to the empire of eternity. As Christians we must never
          surrender our supreme loyalty to any time-bound custom or earth-bound
          idea, for at the heart of our universe is a higher reality - God and
          his kingdom of love - to which we must be conformed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This command not to conform comes not only from Paul, but also from
          our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, the world’s most dedicated
          nonconformist, whose ethical nonconformity still challenges the
          conscience of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an affluent society would coax us to believe that happiness
          consists in the size of our automobiles, the impressiveness of our
          houses, and the expensiveness of our clothes, Jesus reminds us, “A
          man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
          possesseth.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When we would yield to the temptation of a world rife with sexual
          promiscuity and gone wild with a philosophy of self-expression, Jesus
          tells us that “whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath
          committed adultery with her already in his heart.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When we refuse to suffer for righteousness and choose to follow the
          path of comfort rather than conviction, we hear Jesus say, “Blessed
          are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is
          the kingdom of heaven.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When in our spiritual pride we boast of having reached the peak of
          moral excellence, Jesus warns, “The publicans and the harlots go into
          the kingdom of God before you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When we, through compassionless detachment and arrogant individualism,
          fail to respond to the needs of the underprivileged, the Mater says,
          “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my
          brethren, ye have done it unto me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When we allow the spark of revenge in our souls to flame up in hate
          toward our enemies, Jesus teaches, “Love your enemies, pray for them
          which despitefully use you, and persecute you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Everywhere and at all times, the love ethic of Jesus is a radiant
          light revealing the ugliness of our stale conformity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In spite of this imperative demand to live differently, we have
          cultivated a mass mind and have moved from the extreme of rugged
          individualism to the even greater extreme of rugged collectivism. We
          are not makers of history; we are made by history. Longfellow said,
          “In this world a man must either be anvil or hammer,” meaning that he
          is either a molder of society or is molded by society. Who doubts that
          today most men are anvils and are shaped by the patterns of the
          majority? Or to change the figure, most people, and Christians in
          particular, are thermometers that record or register the temperature
          of majority opinion, not thermostats that transform and regulate the
          temperature of society.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people fear nothing more terribly than to take a position that
          stands out sharply and clearly from the prevailing opinion. The
          tendency of most is to adopt a view that is so ambiguous that it will
          include everything and so popular that it will include bigness. We
          live in the age of “jumboism” where men find security in that which is
          large and extensive - big cities, big buildings, big corporations.
          This worship of size has caused many to fear being identified with a
          minority idea. Not a few men, who cherish lofty and noble ideals, hide
          them under a bushel for fear of being called different. Many sincere
          white people in the South privately oppose segregation and
          discrimination, but they are apprehensive lest they be publicly
          condemned. Millions of citizens are deeply disturbed that the
          military-industrial complex too often shapes national policy, but they
          do not want to be considered unpatriotic. Countless loyal Americans
          honestly feel that a world body such as the United Nations should
          include even Red China, but they fear being called Communist
          sympathizers. A legion of thoughtful persons recognizes that
          traditional capitalism must continually undergo change if our great
          national wealth is to be more equitably distributed, but they are
          afraid their criticisms will make them seem un-American. Numerous
          decent, wholesome young persons permit themselves to become involved
          in unwholesome pursuits that they do not personally condone or even
          enjoy, because they are ashamed to say no when the gang says yes. How
          few people have the audacity to express publicly their convictions ,
          and how many have allowed themselves to be “astronomically
          intimidated”!
        </p>
        <p>
          Blind conformity makes us so suspicious of an individual who insists
          on saying what he really believes that we recklessly threaten his
          civil liberties. If a man, who believes vigorously in peace, is
          foolish enough to carry a sign in a public demonstration, or if a
          Southern white person, believing in the American dream of the dignity
          and worth of human personality, dares to invite a Negro into his home
          and join with him in his struggle for freedom, he is liable to be
          summoned before some legislative investigation body. He most certainly
          is a Communist if he espouses the cause of human brotherhood!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thomas Jefferson wrote, “I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal
          hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.” To the
          conformist and the shapers of the conformist mentality, this must
          surely sound like a most dangerous and radical doctrine. Have we
          permitted the lamp of independent thought and individualism to become
          so dim that were Jefferson to write and live by these words today we
          could find cause to harass and investigate him? If Americans permit
          thought-control, business-control, and freedom-control to continue, we
          shall surely move within the shadows of fascism.
        </p>
        <h2>II</h2>
        <p>
          Nowhere is the tragic tendency to conform more evident than in the
          church, an institution that has often served to crystalize, conserve,
          and even bless the patterns of majority opinion. The erstwhile
          sanction by the church of slavery, racial segregation, war, and
          economic exploitation is testimony to the fact that the church has
          hearkened more to the auhtority of the world than to the authority of
          God. Called to be the moral guardian of the community, the church at
          times has preserved that which is immoral and unethical. Called to
          combat social evils, it has remained silent behind stained-glass
          windows. Called ot lead men on the highway of brotherhood and to
          summon them to rise above the narrow confines of race and class, it
          has enunciated and practiced racial exclusiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          We preachers have also been tempted by the enticing cult of
          conformity. Seduced by the success of symbols of the world, we have
          measured our achievements by the size of our parsonage. We have become
          showmen to please the whims and caprices of the people. We preach
          comforting sermons and avoid saying anything from our pulpit that
          might disturb the respectable views of the comfortable members of our
          congregations. Have we ministers of Jesus Christ sacrificed truth on
          the altar of self-interest and, like Pilate, yielded our convictions
          to the demands of the crowd?
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to recapture the gospel glow of the early Christians, who were
          nonconformists in the truest sense of the word and refused to shape
          their witness according to the mundane patterns of the world.
          Willingly they sacrificed fame, fortune, and life itself in behalf of
          a cause they knew to be right. Quantitatively small, they were
          qualitatively giants. Their powerful gospel put an end to such
          barbaric evils as infanticide and bloody gladiatorial contests.
          Finally, they captured the Roman Empire for Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gradually, however, the church became so entrenched in wealth and
          prestige that it began to dilute the strong demands of the gospel and
          to conform to the ways of the world. And ever since the church has
          been a weak and ineffectual trumpet making uncertain sounds. If the
          church of Jesus Christ is to regain once more its power, message, and
          authentic ring, it must conform only to the demands of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hope of a secure and livable world lies with disciplined
          nonconformists, who are dedicated to justice, peace, and brotherhood.
          The trailblazers in human, academic, scientific, and religious freedom
          have always been nonconformists. In any cause that concerns the
          progress of mankind, put your faith in the nonconformist!
        </p>
        <p>
          In his essay “Self-Reliance” Emerson wrote, “Whoso would be a man must
          be a nonconformist.” The Apostle Paul reminds us that whoso would be a
          Christian must also be a nonconformist. Any Christian who blindly
          accepts the opinions of the majority and in fear and timidity follows
          a path of expediency and social approval is a mental and spiritual
          slave. Mark well these words from the pen of James Russell Lowell:
        </p>
        <p class="empoem">
          They are slaves who fear to speak For the fallen and the weak; They
          are slaves who will not choose Hatred, scoffing, and abuse, Rather
          than in silence shrink From the truth they needs must think; They are
          slaves who dare not be In the right with two or three.
        </p>
        <h2>III</h2>
        <p>
          Nonconformity in itself, however, may not necessarily be good and may
          at times possess neither transforming nor redemptive power.
          Nonconformity per se contains no saving value and may represent in
          some circumstances little more than a form of exhibitionism. Paul in
          the latter half of the text offers a formula for constructive
          nonconformity: “Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.”
          Nonconformity is creative when it is controlled and directed by a
          transformed life and is constructive when it embraces a new mental
          outlook. By opening our lives to God in Christ we become new
          creatures. This experience, which Jesus, spoke of as the new birth, is
          essential if we are to be transformed nonconformists and freed from
          the cold hard heartedness and self-righteousness so often
          characteristic of nonconformity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Someone has said, “I love reforms but I hate reformers.” A reformer
          may be an untransformed nonconformist whose rebellion against the
          evils of society has left him annoyingly rigid and unreasonably
          impatient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only through an inner spiritual transformation do we gain the strength
          to fight vigorously the evils of the world in a humble and loving
          spirit. The transformed nonconformist, moreover, never yields to the
          passive sort of patience that is an excuse to do nothing. And this
          very transformation saves him from speaking irresponsible words that
          estrange without reconciling and from making hasty judgments that are
          blind to the necessity of social progress. He recognizes that social
          change will not come overnight, yet he works as though it is an
          imminent possibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          This hour in history needs a dedicated circle of transformed
          nonconformists. Our planet teeters on the brink of atomic
          annihilation; dangerous passions of pride, hatred, and selfishness are
          enthroned in our lives; truth lies prostrate on the rugged hills of
          nameless calvaries; and men do reverence before false gods of
          nationalism and materialism. The saving of our world from pending doom
          will come, not through the complacent adjustment of the conforming
          majority, but through the creative maladjustment of a nonconforming
          minority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some years ago Professor Bixler reminded us of the danger of
          overstressing the well-adjusted life. Everybody passionately seeks to
          be well-adjusted. We must, of course, be well-adjusted if we are to
          avoid neurotic and schizophrenic personalities, but there are some
          things in our world to which men of goodwill must be maladjusted. I
          confess that I never intend to become adjusted to the evils of
          segregation and the crippling effects of discrimination, to the moral
          degeneracy of religious bigotry and the corrding effects of narrow
          sectarianism, to economic conditions that deprive men of work and
          food, and to the insanities of militarism and the self-defeating
          effects of physical violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Human salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted. We
          need today maladjusted men like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who,
          when ordered by King Nebuchadnezzar to bow before a golden image, said
          in unequivocal terms, “If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to
          deliver us… But if not… we will not serve thy gods”; like Thomas
          Jefferson, who in an age adjusted to slavery wrote, “We hold these
          truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they
          are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that
          among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness”; like
          Abraham Lincoln, who had the wisdom to discern that this nation
          couldnt survive half slave and half free; and supremely like our Lord,
          who, in the midst of the intricate and fascinating military machinery
          of the Roman Empire, reminded his disciples that “they that take the
          sword shall perish with the sword.” Through such maladjustment an
          already decadent generation may be called to those things that make
          for peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honesty impels me to admit that transformed nonconformity, which is
          always costly and never altogether comfortable, may mean walking
          through the valley of the shadow of suffering, losing a job, or having
          a six-year-old daughter ask, “Daddy, why do you have to go to jail so
          much?” But we are gravely mistaken to think that Christianity protects
          us from the pain and agony of mortal existence. Christianity has
          always insisted that the cross we bear precedes the crown we wear. To
          be a Christian, one must take up his cross, with all of its
          difficulties and agonizing and tragedy-packed content, and carry it
          until that very cross leaves its marks upon us and redeems us to that
          more excellent way that comes only through suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these days of worldwide confusion, there is a dire need for men and
          women who will courageously do battle for truth. We need Christians
          who will echo the words John Bunyan said to his jailer when, having
          spent twelve years in jail, he was promised freedom if he would agree
          to stop preaching:
        </p>
        <p class="bunyanquote">
          But if nothing will do, unless I make of my conscience a continual
          butchery and slaughter-shop, unless, putting out my own eyes, I commit
          me to the blind to lead me, as I doubt is desired by some, I have
          determined, the Almighty God, being my help and shield, yet to suffer,
          if frail life might continue so long, evren till the moss shall grown
          on mine eyebrows, rather than thus to violate my faith and principles.

          We must make a choice. Will we continue to match to the drumbeat of
          conformity and respectability, or will we, listening to the beat of a
          more distant drum, move to its echoing sounds? Will we march only to
          the music of time, or will we, risking criticism and abuse, march to
          the soul saving music of eternity? More than ever before we are today
          challenged by the words of yesterday, “Be not conformed to this world:
          but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.”
