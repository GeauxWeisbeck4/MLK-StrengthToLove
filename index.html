          "The struggle to eliminate the world's evils - evils so flagrant and
          self-evident that they glare at us from every ghetto street and rural
          hovel - can only occur through a profound internal struggle. By
          reaching into and beyond ourselves and tapping the transcendent moral
          ethic of love, we shall overcome these evils. Love, truth, and the
          courage to do what is right should be our own guideposts on this
          lifelong journey. Martin Luther King Jr. showed us the way; he showed
          us the Dream - and we responded with full heart. Martin was an
          optimist. I am too. I do believe that one day our strength to love
          shall bring the Dream to fruition and the Beloved Community to earth."

        <h2>The Power of the Words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</h2>
        <h3>Introducing: Strength to Love, A Tribute to MLK Jr.</h3>
        <img src="images/mlkstatue.png" alt="martin luther king jr statue" />
        <p class="intro-p">
          Welcome to the Strength to Love website, A Tribute to Martin Luther
          King Jr. Dr. King was a key figure in the fight for civil rights, a
          proponent of democracy, and one of the greatest human beings in
          history. He espoused words of love and courage - words that still ring
          loud and true today through the hearts of many.
          <br />
          <br />
          I know for me personally, I still read Dr. King's words religiously as
          inspiration on how I believe a human should live their life, not only
          as a good Christian, but as a loving human being, who has a duty to
          society to spread love, faith, and courage amongst all people in these
          dark times. By these dark times, I mean a vast inequality in wealth, a
          diminishing of the rights that are sacred to many in our American
          democracy, and a threat so prevelant and dangerous to our democracy,
          that we cannot ignore it and let it continue to bear down on the
          greatest democracy in history.
          <br />
          <br />
          I hope you find this website encouraging and Dr. King's words
          fruitful. I aim to share with you one of my favorite texts of all
          times, with my own personal analysis (hopefully the analysis of others
          in the future), and spread the love and courage of my personal hero.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you believe in the mission of Strength to Love, I would love it if
          you could share with friends and family, or be so kind as to donate to
          my cause. Personally, I have faced the economic hardships of our times
          and it would help me in so many ways. But it would also provide
          incentive and encouragement to put in as much time as possible in to
          making this website as great as possible - there are economic
          tradeoffs, and while I don't expect any monetary rewards for my
          efforts, it would be a great economic motivator to continue to put as
          much effort as possible to continute to spread the wonderful words of
          Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thank you for checking out my site - I am truly grateful you have
          spent the time to read and share this text with me. Until next time,
          may you be blessed with everlasting love and the courage to stand up
          for the message of one of our great leaders in history.
        </p>
